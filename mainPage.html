    <p>Hello World!
    <br>
     I am Rudy Arias with RAK City Code.
     <br>
     My goal is to become part of a team that will make good use of
     my skills.
     I am currently working on Web development full stack with HTML, CSS,(and backend tech).
     Future projects include mobile app development and library proficiency.


     When I am not working on my coding dreams I am spending time with my family, training for marathons or keeping up with current events in different realms of media and entertainment.
     <br>
     At present I am working on getting my Portfolio site off the ground!
     <br>
     Cheers!
